# ModelViewer3D - Comprehensive User Guide

## Overview

ModelViewer3D is a lightweight, high-performance 3D STL model viewer application for Android. It supports both ASCII and Binary STL file formats, allowing you to visualize and interact with 3D models directly on your device.

## Getting Started

### Initial Launch

When you first open ModelViewer3D, the app displays a sample STL file by default. This gives you an immediate preview of how the viewer works and lets you familiarize yourself with the controls before loading your own models.

### File Upload

To view your own 3D models, use the file upload button located in the top bar of the application. This allows you to browse your device's local storage and select STL files to load.

**Supported Formats:**
- ASCII STL files
- Binary STL files

Simply tap the upload button, navigate to your file, and select it. The model will load and render in the main canvas.

## Interaction Controls

The application uses intuitive touch gestures to manipulate your 3D model. All interactions are performed directly on the canvas where your model is displayed.

### One-Finger Rotation

Use a single finger to rotate the model around the canvas. Simply touch the model and drag in any direction to rotate it smoothly in 3D space. This is useful for examining different angles and sides of your model.

**How to rotate:**
1. Place one finger on the canvas
2. Drag your finger across the screen
3. The model rotates according to your finger movement

### Pinch-to-Zoom

Zoom in and out using the standard pinch gesture. Place two fingers on the canvas and pinch them together to zoom out, or spread them apart to zoom in.

**How to zoom:**
1. Place two fingers on the canvas
2. Pinch together to zoom out
3. Spread apart to zoom in
4. The model scales smoothly to your pinch gesture

### Long-Click to Move

Press and hold your finger on the canvas for a moment, then drag to move the model's position within the viewport. This allows you to reposition the model without rotating it, which is helpful for centering or repositioning the view.

**How to move:**
1. Long-press (hold) your finger on the model for a moment
2. While still holding, drag your finger to move the model
3. Release to place the model in its new position

## File Management

### Uploading Files

The top bar contains the file upload interface. You can upload files at any time, and the currently displayed model will be replaced with your newly selected file.

### Performance Considerations

ModelViewer3D is optimized for performance with minimal memory overhead. Even complex 3D models should render smoothly on most Android devices, thanks to the application's lightweight design.
